    <h2>Who We Are</h2>
    <p>Merch Market Hub was founded with one mission: to simplify and scale wholesale procurement in the digital age. Headquartered in Southeast Louisiana, we serve as a procurement bridge between established distributors, manufacturers, and the e-commerce platforms where consumers shop every day.</p>
<p>Our team brings together experience in online retail, logistics, supply chain operations, and brand protection. We understand what it takes to succeed as a third-party seller — and more importantly, how to build sustainable supply relationships with our vendor partners.</p>
<p>Our procurement model is built on three values:</p>
<ul style="text-align:left; max-width: 600px; margin: auto;">
  <li><strong>Reliability:</strong> We pay on time, follow through on commitments, and maintain consistent communication.</li>
  <li><strong>Compliance:</strong> We protect brand integrity through MAP enforcement, clean listings, and authorized resale policies.</li>
  <li><strong>Growth-Oriented:</strong> We’re not interested in one-time buys — we’re here to build reorder pipelines and long-term volume deals.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our network includes everything from regional distributors to national brand owners. We’re constantly refining our sourcing systems, expanding our fulfillment capabilities, and investing in tools that make wholesale smoother for everyone involved.</p>
